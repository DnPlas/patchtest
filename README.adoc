== Patchtest

Patchtest can run on either a host or a guest machine. If patchtest is intented
to be run automatically, it makes sense to run it inside a guest machine.
On this guide, guest installation/executing is done using https://www.vagrantup.com/[vagrant]
with libvirt as provider and kvm/qemu as kernel/user-space hypervisors. Patchtest installation
and execution depends on where patchtest will be executed (host or guest),
so the following two sections present both targets.

[[host]]
=== Host

WARNING: Testing series coming from patchwork without inspection may be risky on a insufficiently secured
environment; if this is the case, consider executing patchtest in a guest machine as indicated on the
<<guest, guest >> section.

[[host-installation]]
[source,shell]
----
host:~$ sudo apt-get update
host:~$ sudo apt-get install -y git python python-virtualenv python-pip
----

Then, define the following variables manually

[source,shell]
----
host:~$ REPODIR=""   #<Define where you want the repository to be located>
host:~$ REPOURL=""   #<Define the repository's git URL>
host:~$ PWURL=""     #<Define where the Patchwork's URL>
host:~$ PWPROJECT="" #<Define patchwork's related project>
host:~$ PWUSER=""    #<Define the Patchwork's user>
host:~$ PWPASS=""    #<Define the PWUSER's password>
----

For example, these settings correspond to the http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/[poky]
project

[source,shell]
----
host:~$ REPODIR="$HOME/poky"
host:~$ REPOURL="http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky"
host:~$ PWURL="http://patchwork.openembedded.org/"
host:~$ PWPROJECT="oe-core"
host:~$ PWUSER="xxxx"
host:~$ PWPASS="yyyy"
----

finally, clone the patchtest repository and install the test suite as submodule

[source,shell]
----
host:~$ git clone ssh://git@git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest
host:~$ cd patchtest
host:patchtest$ git submodule add https://github.com/lsandoval/patchtest-sample-test-suite tests/sample
host:patchtest$ scripts/setup-patchtest.sh
host:patchtest$ scripts/setup-repodir.sh $REPODIR $REPOURL $PWURL $PWPROJECT $PWUSER $PWPASS
----

https://github.com/lsandoval/patchtest-sample-test-suite[A sample test suite] is provided for demo purposes
(a template) but for real purposes, create a test suite targeting your project purposes.

Under the patchtest folder, run the following command every time you need to process
latest (if case there are) series

[source,shell]
----
REPODIR="$HOME/poky"
host:patchtest$ scripts/run-patchtest.sh $REPODIR
----

[[guest]]
=== Guest

Install http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page[qemu] and https://libvirt.org/[libvirt] on your system.
Then install vagrant (check main page for installation instructions) and the following plugin

[source,shell]
----
host:~$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
----

Vagrant needs a base folder, which is the folder to be shared between host and guest, so
create one and clone patchtest from it

[source,shell]
----
host:~$ mkdir vagrant-patchtest
host:~$ cd vagrant-patchtest
host:vagrant-patchtest$ git clone ssh://git@git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest
host:vagrant-patchtest$ cp patchtest/vagrant/Vagrantfile .
host:vagrant-patchtest$ vagrant up --provider libvirt
----

Provisioning the new machine will take some time: it will execute all steps mentioned on the
<<host-installation, Host installation>> automatically. Finally, connect to it and install the test suite as submodule

[source,shell]
----
host:vagrant-patchtest$ vagrant ssh
guest:~$ cd /vagrant/patchtest
guest:patchtest$ git submodule add https://github.com/lsandoval/patchtest-sample-test-suite tests/sample
guest:patchtest$ scripts/setup-patchtest.sh
guest:patchtest$ exit
host:vagrant-patchtest$
----

Under the vagrant-patchtest folder, run the following command every time you need to process latest
(if case there are) series

[source,shell]
----
host:vagrant-patchtest$ vagrant provision
----
