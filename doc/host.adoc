=== Host Installation and Execution
[WARNING]
Testing series coming from 'patchwork' without inspection may be risky on a insufficiently secured
environment; if this is the case, it is [red]#strongly recommended# to execute patchtest in a guest machine
as indicated on the <<guest, guest >> section.

[[env-vars]]
* Define the following environment variables

[source,shell]
----
$ BASE=$PWD/pt
$ PW=$BASE/patchwork
$ PT=$BASE/patchtest
$ PTOE=$BASE/patchtest-oe
$ SUITE=$PTOE/tests
$ OECORE=$BASE/openembedded-core
-----

[[cloning]]
* Clone repositories
[NOTE]
In case your already have the repositories, make sure you update them before testing.
The 'patchtest' and in this case the suite, are live projects and checks are being added
constantly.

[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir $BASE
$ git clone https://github.com/dlespiau/patchwork.git $PW
$ git clone ssh://git@git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest $PT
$ git clone ssh://git@git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest-oe $PTOE
$ git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core $OECORE
$ export PATH="$PATH:$PW/git-pw/:$PT"
----

[[path]]
* Append tool paths into the environment 'PATH' variable

[source,shell]
----
$ export PATH="$PATH:$PW/git-pw/:$PT"
----

[[requirements]]
* Install `git-pw` and test suite python requirements using 'pip'
[NOTE]
You can use your distribution package manager instead of 'pip' to install
the requirements

[source,shell]
----
$ cd $PW/git-pw; pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd $PWOE; pip install -r requirements.txt
----

The tool is ready to be used. It is worth mentioned again that the above
steps consider the 'OE-core' and its corresponding suite 'patchtest-oe'
as examples. Any other project/suite can be configured in a similar way,
just the upstream links would change, but the rest of the instructions
remain valid. Section <<usage, usage>> shows some command line examples
to use the tools just installed.
