=== Host execution
[WARNING]
Testing series coming from 'patchwork' without inspection may be risky on an insufficiently secured
environment; if that is the case, it is [red]#strongly recommended# to execute patchtest in a guest machine
as indicated on the <<guest, guest>> section.


* Clone repositories

NOTE: the following steps consider the 'OE-core' and its corresponding suite ('patchtest-oe')
as examples. Any other project/suite can be configured in a similar fashion.

[source,shell]
----
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest-oe
----

[[requirements]]
* Using 'pip', install the python requirements for both projects
[NOTE]
You can use your distribution package manager instead of 'pip' to install
such python requirements

[source,shell]
----
cd <path to patchtest>; pip install -r requirements.txt
cd <path to patchtest-oe>; pip install -r requirements.txt
----

* Test a patch (patch can be those produdced by git-format-patch or an standard mbox)
[source,shell]
----
patchtest <some patch> --repo-dir <path to patchtest> --start-dir <path to /pachtest-oe/tests>
----
