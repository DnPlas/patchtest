=== Host installation and Guest execution: a **secure** approach

This method is the recommended way when patch testing is done automatically, i.e. through a 'cronjob'. However,
if you want to test patches your own patches, the <<host,host>> approach is a better option, making it easier and
faster the code cycle ('code-test-code').

* As in the <<host, host>> section, follow the steps <<env-vars, environment variables setting>> and <<cloning, cloning>>.

* TODO: include `chmod` lines to remove write permission into the  '$BASE' folders, so guest can not touch it.

* Poll new series events from the patchwork instance, previously configured as shown <<pw, Patchwork>> section.

[source, shell]
----
$PT/scripts/poll $OECORE $BASE
----

The above script will create a new folder under '$BASE' containing the mboxes for every
new series-revision polled. The link 'latest-series' will point to the new folder.

* Using the https://www.yoctoproject.org/[Yocto Project] system, create a 'qemu' machine including
the 'meta-patchtest' layer (located on this repository).
[NOTE]
In case of trouble, please refer to the main Yocto Project https://www.yoctoproject.org/documentation[documentation]
for more information, specially the Yocto Project Quick Start Guide document.

[source,shell]
----
cd $BASE
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
cd poky
. oe-init-build-env
echo "BBLAYERS += \"$PT/meta-patchtest\"' >> conf/bblayers.conf
bitbake core-image-patchtest
----

* Launch (from the Poky 'build' folder) the 'qemu' machine with the following parameters

[source, shell]
----
runqemu qemux86 \
	core-image-patchtest \
	nographic \
	kvm \
	qemuparams="-fsdev local,id=test_dev,path=$BASE,security_model=mapped \
	            -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=test_dev,mount_tag=test_mount"
----

The 'qemu' parameters indicate the shared folder ('$BASE') between host and guest,
containing all necessary data for patchtest to be run in isolation. This folder
is now a (paravirtualized) filesystem using 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2010/ols2010-pages-109-120.pdf[VirtFS].
With this model, host view shows QEMU as the owner of all files created by any user 
(including root) on the guest hence provides complete isolation and security
[1].

* The machine, once launched, will automatically execute 'patchtest'
with all the new series and results stored in the 'latest-results' folder.

* TODO: we should avoid this step, using a 'qemu' parameter to take
a clean image for every run.
For security reasons, remove the 'qemu' machine

[source,shell]
----
cd $POKY/build
bitbake -c cleanall core-image-minimal
----

* Finally, in case results need to be posted into the 'patchwork' instance, execute the following script

[source, shell]
----
build$PTOE/scripts/post $OECORE $BASE/latest-results
----

where '$BASE/latest-results' contains previous results executed on guest.
