=== Usage

When testing patches locally you can run the tool manually on your local
host. Before testing, follow the <<host, host>> installation
steps. In this section we focus on simple usages of the tool.

'Patchtest' can only accept a **single** patch either from stdin

[source,shell]
----
cd $REPO
git format-patch -1 --stdout | patchtest - --start-directory $START
----

or as parameter

[source,shell]
----
patchtest somepatch.patch --start-directory $START
----

You can see the test results on the console (passes, fails and skips tests). There are others parameters
you can include, see `patchtest -h` for more help.
