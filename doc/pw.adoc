=== Patchwork and `git-pw`

New series can be fetched from a 'patchwork' instance using `git-pw` tool
but first some configurations are needed on the target repository.
For the 'OE-core' case, set the following

[source,shell]
----
$ cd $OECORE
$ git config patchwork.default.url http://patchwork.openembedded.org
$ git config patchwork.default.project oe-core
----

and fetch and test in the same command line

[source,shell]
----
$ git pw mbox 1487 | patchtest - --test-dir $SUITE
----

'patchwork' can also store test results, thus two more configurations are needed
in order to post results.

[source,shell]
----
$ git config patchwork.default.user <service account>
$ git config patchwork.default.pass <service password>
----

where the service account is a dedicated patchwork account configured to be a maintainer for a specific patchwork
project, in this case 'OpenEmbedded Core Layer'.
