=== Patchwork and `git-pw`

New series can be fetched from a 'patchwork' instance using `git-pw` tool
but first some configurations are needed on the target repository.
For the 'OE-core' case, set the following

[[pw-project-config]]
[source,shell]
----
cd $REPO
PWURL='http://patchwork.openembedded.org'
PWPROJECT='oe-core'
git config patchwork.default.url $PWURL
git config patchwork.default.project $PWPROJECT
----

and fetch and test in the same command line

[source,shell]
----
git pw mbox 1487 | patchtest - --test-dir $START
----

'patchwork' can also post test results using `git-pw post-result`, thus two more configurations (credentials) are needed


[[pw-user-config]]
[source,shell]
----
git config patchwork.default.user <service account>
git config patchwork.default.pass <service password>
----

where the service account is a dedicated patchwork account configured to be a maintainer for a specific patchwork
project, in this case 'OpenEmbedded Core Layer'. See `git-pw` help for more info on how to post results from
the command line.
