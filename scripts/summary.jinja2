Thank you for submitting this patch series to {{project}}. This is
an automated response. Several tests have been executed on the proposed
series by patchtest resulting in the following {% if fail %}failures{% else %}results{%endif%}:

{% for result in results %}
{% if result.commit %}* Patch            {{ result.commit.subject }}
  {% else %}* {% endif %}Issue            {{ result.issue }} [{{ result.test_name }}]
{% if result.fix %}  Suggested fix    {{ result.fix }}
{% endif %}{% for extra in result.data %}  {{ extra[0].ljust(16) }} {{ extra[1] }}
{% endfor %}{% endfor %}

If you believe any of these test results are incorrect, please reply to the
mailing list ({{mailinglist}}) raising your concerns.
Otherwise we would appreciate you correcting the issues and submitting a new
version of the patchset if applicable. Please ensure you add/increment the
version number when sending the new version (i.e. [PATCH] -> [PATCH v2] ->
[PATCH v3] -> ...).
