Thank you for submitting this patch series to {{project}}. This is
an automated response. Several tests have been executed on the proposed
series (series {{series}}, revision {{revision}}) by patchtest and the
following have {% if fail %}failed{% else %}passed/skipped{%endif%}:

{% for lines in results %}{% for k, v in lines %}
{% if 'Test ID' in k%}{{k}}{{' '*10}}{{v}}{%else%}{{k}}{{' '*(17-(k|length))}}{{v}}{%endif%}{%endfor%}
{% endfor %}

If you believe any of these test results are incorrect, please reply to the
mailing list ({{mailinglist}}) raising your concerns.
Otherwise we would appreciate you correcting the issues and submitting a new
version of the patchset if applicable. Please ensure you add/increment the
version number when sending the new version (i.e. [PATCH] -> [PATCH v2] ->
[PATCH v3] -> ...).
